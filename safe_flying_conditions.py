#       Algorithm
#           Call open_file function to get file pointers to neccisary files
#           Skip the header lines in the given csv file
#           Get dictionary of data from calling read_file function
#           Filter the dictionary to fit restrictions
#           Skip header of civil_twilight.txt
#           Turn data of civil_twilight into a dictionary
#           Check each key/value pair in data_dict 
#               If the time of the dictionary entry is not between dawn and dusk for that day
#                   Add that dictionary entry to a list of other entries that don't meet the daylight requirments
#           Go though list of faulty dictionary entries and delete them from the dictionary
#           Print header in csv file
#           Format each dictionary entry and print the formatted entry in the csv file
#           Count each line printed in the csv file
#           Display total data points in csv file in console
#
#           Loops through the data points in the created csv file
#               Checks if the current runway is safe based on data point conditions
#               Checks if the proposed runway is safe based on data point conditions
#               If either is safe, it adds the data point to the corresponding runways' dictionary and set
#
#           Creates a set of all the similar data points between the current and proposed runway
#           Displays all the data points to the corresponding runway file based on if the data point is safe 
#           Displays counts of the current, proposed, and combined runways safe data points
